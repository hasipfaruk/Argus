# Contributing to Argus

Thanks for considering a contribution. Argus is designed so that most
additions — new scanners, languages, compliance rules, report formats — land as
plugins and never touch the core. That keeps the barrier low and the core stable.

## Getting set up

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hasipfaruk/Argus
cd argus
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Run the checks:

```bash
pytest              # tests
ruff check .        # lint
mypy                # type check (advisory during alpha)
```

All three run in CI on every pull request; please make sure they pass locally
first.

## What makes a good contribution

- **New scanners and rules.** The highest-value contributions. See
  [docs/plugins.md](docs/plugins.md). New rules for the built-in `patterns` and
  `iac` scanners are just entries in a list.
- **Language support.** Extend `argus/analysis/languages.py` and add
  language-specific rules or a dedicated scanner.
- **Report formats.** Subclass `Reporter`.
- **AI providers.** Wrap another model backend behind `AIProvider`.

## Standards

- **Tests are required** for new behavior. Put fixtures in `tests/conftest.py` and
  keep tests deterministic — the default offline provider makes this easy.
- **Every finding must carry a CWE and OWASP mapping** and, ideally, the reasoning
  fields so it is useful without a model.
- **Keep the core dependency-light.** New heavy dependencies belong behind an
  optional extra (`pip install argus-appsec[...]`), like the cloud providers.
- **Match the house style.** Ruff enforces formatting and imports; follow the
  patterns in the existing scanners.

## Security rules of the road

Argus is a security tool; contributions should reflect that.

- The Attack Simulation feature is **educational and non-executing** by design. Do
  not add anything that runs generated exploits or sends traffic to live targets
  without an explicit, opt-in, sandboxed design discussed in an issue first.
- If you find a vulnerability *in Argus itself*, please report it privately (see
  [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)) rather than opening a public issue.

## Pull request process

1. Open an issue for anything non-trivial so we can agree on the approach.
2. Branch from `main`, keep the change focused.
3. Add tests and docs.
4. Ensure `pytest`, `ruff check .`, and `mypy` pass.
5. Describe the change and its motivation in the PR.
