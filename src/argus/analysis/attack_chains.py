"""Attack-chain analysis: correlate individual findings into breach paths.

A single finding is easy to ignore; a chain is not. When several findings in the
same component compose ("untrusted input reaches a prompt, and model output reaches
a shell" or "an injection sits in the same file as a hardcoded credential"), the
combined impact is materially worse than any part, and the story is concrete
enough to act on. This upgrades Argus's claim from "explains findings" to
"explains risk".

Chains are emitted as their own findings (scanner ``chains``) that reference their
members, so they flow through every reporter without new plumbing.
