"""Import-level reachability analysis for dependency findings (experimental).

Most SCA tools flag every advisory that matches a pinned version, but a large
share of those alerts concern packages the first-party code never even imports,
noise that teaches teams to ignore the scanner. This module implements the
first tier of reachability: an **imported / not imported** verdict for Python
projects, computed from the project's own source (vendored and virtualenv
directories are already excluded by the project walker).

Deliberately heuristic and honest about it:

* It matches *top-level module names*, mapping distribution names to import
  names (``pyyaml`` → ``yaml``) via normalization plus a small alias table.
* "Imported" does **not** prove the vulnerable function is called (that is the
  call-graph tier, planned); "not imported" can be wrong for dynamic imports
  (``importlib``, plugins) or an unmapped import alias. Verdicts therefore
  annotate findings, they never suppress them.

Later tiers (symbol-level matching against OSV affected functions, call-graph
confirmation) build on this same interface.
