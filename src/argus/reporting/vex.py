"""OpenVEX reporter.

Emits an OpenVEX (https://openvex.dev) document describing the exploitability of
each known-vulnerable dependency Argus found. VEX is the machine-readable standard
for "this CVE is present but not exploitable here", and it is the formal
expression of Argus's reachability analysis: a dependency whose vulnerable code is
never imported is reported as ``not_affected`` with the standard justification,
while a reachable one is ``affected`` with the fix. Pairing this with an SBOM is
increasingly requested by enterprise buyers.

Only findings that carry a CVE (the dependency scanner's output) are VEX-relevant;
SAST, secret, and IaC findings are not about third-party components and are
omitted.
