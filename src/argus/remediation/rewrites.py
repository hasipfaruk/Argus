"""Deterministic, line-level fix rewrites.

A rewrite maps a finding's ``rule_id`` to a function that transforms the offending
source line into a fixed one, preserving surrounding syntax and indentation (the
function operates on the real line, so whitespace is kept automatically). These
are the fixes Argus can apply and verify locally without a model:

* ``fix_line`` applies the rewrite for a rule to a line.
* ``verify_line_fixed`` confirms the rewrite actually removes the detection, a
  fast, local proxy for "the fix resolves the issue".

Both the :class:`~argus.agents.patch.PatchAgent` (which proposes patches) and the
:mod:`~argus.remediation.applier` (which writes them to disk) use this module, so
proposal and application can never drift apart.
