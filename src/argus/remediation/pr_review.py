"""Post scan findings as a pull-request review (the Argus PR bot).

Given a scan's findings and a checked-out pull request, this posts the findings
that land on lines the PR changed as **inline** GitHub review comments, and lists
any remaining new findings in the review summary. Paired with ``--baseline``
(diff-aware scanning), this yields the "comment only on what this PR introduces"
behavior that lets teams adopt a scanner without drowning in pre-existing debt.

The parsing and comment-building are pure and unit-tested; the network calls live
in :mod:`argus.remediation.hosting`.
