"""The heuristic (offline) provider.

This is the default so that ``argus scan`` produces useful, self-contained output
with no API key and no network. Instead of calling a model, it fills the
AI-authored fields of a finding from templates keyed on the finding's taxonomy
(CWE / OWASP / category). It is intentionally deterministic, good for tests and
for air-gapped environments, and is transparently weaker than a real model.
