"""Baseline / diff-aware scanning support.

A *baseline* is a previously written Argus JSON report. Comparing the current
scan against it lets CI report and gate on **only new findings**, the single
most important feature for adopting a scanner on an existing codebase without
drowning in pre-existing debt.

Matching is by :meth:`~argus.core.models.Finding.fingerprint`, which is keyed on
the (whitespace-normalized) offending code rather than the raw line number, so a
finding is still recognized as "known" after unrelated edits move it.
