"""The scan engine: orchestrates a full analysis.

Pipeline:

1. **Analyze**, build the project model (languages, frameworks, architecture).
2. **Scan**, run every applicable scanner, collecting findings.
3. **Enrich**, run agents over each finding (reasoning, attack simulation,
   patch generation) according to config.
4. **Assemble**, filter by severity, sort, and package into a ``ScanResult``.

The engine returns a ``ScanResult`` and never modifies the target; its only
write is to Argus's own cache directory (disable with ``--no-cache``).
Reporting and PR creation are separate steps.

Performance: scanners run concurrently (they are independent by design), and
file-local scanners cache findings per file content hash so warm scans only
re-analyze changed files. Both are on by default and both preserve Argus's
determinism guarantee, findings, ids, and ordering are identical with or
without cache and parallelism.
