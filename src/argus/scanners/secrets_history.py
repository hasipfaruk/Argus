"""Scan git history for secrets that were committed and later removed.

The working-tree secrets scan misses the most dangerous real-world case: a
credential that was committed, then deleted in a later commit. It is gone from the
current files but still trivially recoverable from history, so the correct
remediation is to *rotate* it, not just delete it.

This walks the diffs across all of history (bounded, so a huge repo cannot hang a
scan), runs the high-precision secret signatures on added lines, and reports each
unique secret with the commit that introduced it. Only signature matches are used
(not entropy) to keep history noise low. Every git call uses an argument array,
never a shell.
