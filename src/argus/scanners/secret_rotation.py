"""Track discovered *live* secrets across scans to catch the most dangerous state:
"found, but never rotated".

A one-off scan tells you a credential is live today. What matters operationally is
whether it is *still* live weeks later, i.e. nobody rotated it. This keeps a small
local state file (only redacted fingerprints and dates, never the secret itself)
so a later scan can say "this key has been live for 30 days and is still not
rotated" and escalate accordingly. A credential that stops appearing live is
treated as resolved and dropped from the state.

This pairs with ``--verify-secrets`` (which sets the ``verification`` verdict). It
is a lightweight local version of the hosted rotation tracker.
