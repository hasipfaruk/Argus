"""Static analysis via language-aware source patterns.

This is a lightweight, regex-based SAST pass. Coverage is deepest for Python and
JavaScript/TypeScript, plus a few language-agnostic checks (weak hashing, disabled
TLS verification, path traversal). It is intentionally rule-driven: each rule is a
small dataclass, and adding coverage, including new languages, means appending a
rule, not touching the scanner. A plugin can register a more precise, AST-based
scanner for a specific language and coexist with this one.

Every rule carries the reasoning fields (why / attacker view / impact) and a CWE
and OWASP mapping so findings are actionable without an AI provider present.
