"""Golden-file integration test: an end-to-end scan of a pinned fixture must keep
producing the same normalized findings. This catches cross-cutting regressions no
unit test sees (a change in one tier that quietly drops or moves a finding).

When the diff is an intentional improvement, regenerate the golden:
    python -m pytest tests/test_golden_snapshot.py  # see the printed diff, then
    update tests/fixtures/golden_app.expected.json to match.
